### Remindars

WarBOT features three ways to remind you now.

First, you can have the bot remind you in the current channel, and tag you.
```
bot, remind me 5m My message goes here
```
If, the bot does not have permissions to send to that channel, it will instead remind you via DM.

Second, you can have a remindar sent via DM.
```
bot, remind dm 5m DM My message goes here
```

Last, you can have the bot send a message to the channel, without tagging you.
```
bot, remind here 5m My message goes here
```
### Bot Status

WarBOT will now update his status to let you know how long until the next prep peroid, or how long until war starts.

### Discord Bot List

Warbot will now update its guild count every couple hours on the discord bot list.
