## Highlights

WarBOT v4.0 is now production! Version 4.1.0 is the version currently released to production.

WarBot v3.0 is official retired.

As such, [https://warbot.dev/](https://warbot.dev/) is now utilized for warbot prod, while warbot dev's config site is located at [https://dev.warbot.dev/](https://dev.warbot.dev/)

Each bot will give the proper configuration site when you execute `/setup`

#### Performance Issues

Upon firing up the new UI and pointing at production, I noticed it took upwards of 30 seconds to resolve a list of guilds Warbot is apart of. While, Warbot is in.... QUITE a few guilds, this was unexpected.

In order to not delay go-live/release date, I disabled the logic which checks if Warbot is in a guild or not. So... you can now configure a guild that warbot is not yet a member of.

As well, the channel selector is a tad slow, BUT, bearable for the time being. I will address the performance issues in the future.

#### Other Minor / Misc 

##### Edit form correction

When editing guild events, you would often get an error message saying channel is required, even after selecting a channel. 
This has been resolved.

##### Welcome Message

The welcome message (The message you see when you add WarBOT to your guild) has been modified slightly to include a link to this website. (docs.warbot.dev)
