## Changes

There should be no noticable changes. This update is all updates, and backend cleanup. 

## Backend Changes

### Kubernetes

Warbot has been migrated over to a brand-new Kubernetes Cluster. This should make him slightly more reliable.

### .NET 7

Warbot has been updated to run on .net 7. This should make him faster.

### Package / Security Updates

This should make Warbot more secure, and potentially more reliable.

### Tooling updates

Also, built out new CI/CD pipeline using ansible to build, test, and deploy images. This should make it easier to push out changes.
