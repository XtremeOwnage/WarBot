## Changes

### [#73](https://github.com/XtremeOwnage/WarBot/issues/73) `/show config` now displays expeditions

When executing `/show config`, you can now view the configuration for Hustle Castle Expeditions.

### `/show config` will show the currently configured clearing method for hustle events.

When viewing hustle castle wars, portals, or expeditions, you can now see the message/channel clearing method used.

### [#78](https://github.com/XtremeOwnage/WarBot/issues/78) Configure Message Clearing via Commands

Added two new commands to configure message clearing functionality via discord commands.

* `/war clear`
* `/expedition clear`

The commands allow you to configure the method, and delay of message clearing functionality. 

!!! info
    These commands will currently default to a one hour delay if you do not provide a value for delay!

Created issue [#79](https://github.com/XtremeOwnage/WarBot/issues/79) to add in documentation for these new commands in the future.

## Minor Changes

### Removed GUILD_PRESENCE intent, as we are not utilizing it. 

This will save a tiny amount of load.
