For those interested in the major version releases of WarBOT.....

## Version 1.0

I legit do not remember anything about this version. 

## Version 2.0

This version of WarBOT was written in Javascript, utilizing node.js, and discord.js. 

This is the first chatbot I had written, which was actually utilized.

## Version 3.0

The entire bot was re-written in .net core. 

This version achieved over 100,000 concurrent users. 

## Version 4.0

Most of the bot was re-written to no longer leverage parsed message commands, and instead leverage discord's commands. 

As well, the bot was updated to .NET 6.

The largest addition to this version asides from using application commands, is the inclusion of its [Configuration Website](https://warbot.dev/) allowing the bot to be configured without the use of any commands.
