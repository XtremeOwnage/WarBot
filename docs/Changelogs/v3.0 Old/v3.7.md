# Major Changes

## Bot, Clear Messages

Some clever workarounds were created to allow ALL messages in a channel to be deleted(Not just the previous two weeks).
The only caveot- after the first two weeks of messages are deleted, it will slowly delete the rest. This is due to discord's API. Depending on how many messages you have in this channel, this may take a long time.

# Minor Changes

## bot, test war messages

This command will now verify and validate permissions are set properly. If the bot is missing a permission, this command will let you know.

# Bug Fixes

## Role Deleted

War bot has a feature to let you know if you delete a role specified in its configuration. A piece of logic was missing to only send alerts when the role deleted was in its configuration. This has been resolved.
