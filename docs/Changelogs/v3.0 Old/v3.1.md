# Major Changes

## Portal Remindar

### WarBOT will now send a message once a week when the portal is opened!

### To Change the message:

```
bot, set portal (Put your custom message here. Optional to set a message.)
```

### To enable, or disable
```
bot, disable portal
bot, enable portal
```
### Setup Dialog

You may also configure portal settings, via the setup dialog.

## User Left Guild Notification

### WarBOT now has the ability to let you know when somebody leaves your discord guild

### To enable or disable

```
bot, enable leave #Channel
bot, disable leave
```

It may also be configured via the guild setup dialog.

# Minor Changes

## Dialogs

Dialogs will automatically clean up messages after the dialog is closed.

## Show Config

The 'bot, show config' section will now list the settings you have configured for new user greeting messages.

# Bug Fixes

## Bot's Prefix

I noticed a bug where many people were getting Command not found errors when doing simple things like bot, help.

I realized, they had the prefix set to 'bot' and not 'bot,' so the command was being interpreted as ', help' instead of 'help'.

This release rolls out a fix, which will automatically handle a preceding comma.

# New Commands / Updated Commands

* Added commands related to portal notification management.
* Added commands related to users leaving the discord guild.
