# The big ToDo list before moving v4.0 to prod.

1. Communication to all current users of WarBOT.
    * Users will need to remove, and re-add the bot to add the new application commands permissions.
    * All configurations will need to be reset.
2. Voting / Polls functionality.
    * Needs to be added back in.


## Nice to have

1. Re-implement "Test Messages" functionality.
2. Add better detection of invalid configurations. 
    * ie- detect if we can actually send messages to a channel configured by the user.
    * ensure we can actually manage the roles in both role management, and custom actions.
3. Custom Command Improvements
    * Ability to add parameters. Ie, User, Channel, Role. etc.
4. Custom Actions for guilds events.
    * Ie- trigger custom action when user joins / leaves guild.
