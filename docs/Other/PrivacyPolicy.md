## What information we collect from users

#### Custom Commands
Your user ID may be added to custom commands created by guild leaders. This is outside of our control.

#### Browser Authentication

When you authenticate to https://warbot.dev/, a cookie needs to be stored in your browser to authenticate you.

In the future, it is planned to store your preferred language, however, this feature is not implemented yet.

## What information we collect from guilds.

1. The number of members in a guild. This is used to gauge how much load the bot may be under.
2. Errors related to your guild. I will see messages for these situations:
    1. If we cannot deliver a critical message, a log will be created stating we could not deliver a message for guild "guild name"
3. Guilds which have added or removed WarBOT.

## How can you opt-out of collection

Given, we do not collect or log any user information, there is nothing to opt-out of.

Any information which is collected, is high-level metrics. IE, how many times has someone used a command, globally.
